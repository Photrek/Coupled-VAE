# Coupled Variational Autoencoder
Generalizes the Variational Autoencoder using the methods of Nonlinear Statistical Coupling
  a. The Coupled Evidence Lower Bound uses generalized logarithms to provide tuning of the loss functions, particularly to improve the robustness of the learned models.
  b. The Coupled Normal Distribution generalizes the latent layer providing increased flexibility regarding the learned model.
